R code for the publication "Post-windthrow forest management alters the successional pathways of bird communities in a temperate pine forest"


All graphics created with the code were later modified using CorelDRAW (and tables were modified using excel) - therefore do not expect exact same graphics in code output and the publication.


Feel free to use and copy the code in whatever way you wish! 

In case you have any questions about it, please write mwalesiak@ibs.bialowieza.pl
